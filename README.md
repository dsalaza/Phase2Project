# Record Review

Record Review is a communal space that allows you to share reviews of your favorite albums!

## Usage

To use Record Review, simply pick an album and enter the relevant information into the form on the Review page. Upon completion, your review will be published in a stylish card and added to the database that renders on the Explore page! The explore page is a great place to see what other albums people have been reviewing.

To find high-quality album art, I recommend using https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/.
